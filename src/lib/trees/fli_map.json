	"description": "The project of creating value-aligned AI is perhaps one of the most important things we will ever do. However, there are open and often neglected questions regarding what is exactly entailed by 'beneficial AI.' Value alignment is the project of one day creating beneficial AI and has been expanded outside of its usual technical context to reflect and model its truly interdisciplinary nature. For value-aligned AI to become a reality, we need to not only solve intelligence, but also the ends to which intelligence is aimed and the social/political context, rules, and policies in and through which this all happens. This landscape synthesizes a variety of AI safety research agendas along with other papers in AI, machine learning, ethics, governance, and AI safety, robustness, and beneficence research. It lays out what technical research threads can help us to create beneficial AI, and describes how these many topics tie together.",

Validation is the process of ensuring that a system that meets its formal requirements does not have undesirable behaviors or consequences. It is asking the question \"Did I build (or ask for) the right system?\".<br><br> Ensuring that the formal requirements, the specification, considers all relevant dynamics, and will be beneficial and desirable, does not actually fit into current formally provable paradigms. In order to build systems that robustly behave well, one currently needs to decide what<i> good</i> behavior means in each application domain. This ethical question of good is tied closely to questions of what technologies and engineering techniques are available, how reliable they are, and what trade-offs can be made \ufffd all areas where computer science, software engineering, machine learning, and broader AI expertise are valuable. In practical application, a significant consideration is the computational expense of different behavioral standards or ethical theories, i.e. that if a standard cannot be evaluated sufficiently expeditiously to guide behavior in safety-critical situations, cheaper approximations should be used (<a href='https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moral-machines-9780195374049' target='_blank'>Wallach and Allen 2008</a>).

Being able to assure known bounded behaviors from methods and systems that learn will also be important for both medium-term and long-term safety. Validation encompasses ensuring an agent understands its environment, decisions, and actions, and that it acts robustly-in-accordance with its operators' wishes.<br><br> In the long term, AI systems might become much more powerful, general-purpose, and autonomous, a regime where failures of validity would carry significantly higher costs than with today's systems. To maximize the long-term value of validity research, machine learning researchers might focus on anticipating, preventing, detecting, and mitigating the types of otherwise unexpected generalization that would be most problematic for very general and capable AI systems. If some concepts could be learned reliably, it might become possible to use those to define tasks or constraints that minimize the chances of unintended consequences even when agents become very general and capable.

In addition to generally being more robust and accurate, this inclusion critically helps the agent include the effects of its internal dynamics on the environment. It can also provide a formal grounding for more realistic game theoretic analyses (<a href='http://www.auai.org/uai2016/proceedings/papers/87.pdf' target='_blank'>Leike et al. 2016</a>). Updated paradigms are needed to model how generally intelligent agents that are embedded in their environments should reason (<a href='https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf' target='_blank'>Soares 2015</a>, <a href='http://agi-conference.org/2012/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/paper_76.pdf' target='_blank'>Orseau and Ring 2012</a>). Identification of the induction problem itself, as analog to Solomonoff induction, in the scenario of an agent both embedded in and computed by its environment, is termed naturalized induction, and can benefit from more research (<a href='https://intelligence.org/files/ReflectiveSolomonoffAIXI.pdf' target='_blank'>Fallenstein et al. 2015</a>, <a href='https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf' target='_blank'>Soares 2015</a>, <a href='http://lesswrong.com/lw/jd9/building_phenomenological_bridges/' target='_blank'>RobbBB 2013</a>). The agent would need to consider what the possible environments that could be embedding the agent are, and determining a good simplicity prior would help to create a distribution or weighing of those possibilities (<a href='http://intelligence.org/files/TechnicalAgenda.pdf' target='_blank'>Soares and Fallenstein 2014a</a>).<br><br> Understanding this analog to Solomonoff Induction would help us circumscribe some theoretical limits around such agents. Deficiencies in such capabilities can lead to the type of agent that finds clever ways to seize control of its observation channel, rather than actually identifying and manipulating the features in the world that the reward function was intended to proxy for (<a href='https://intelligence.org/files/RealisticWorldModels.pdf' target='_blank'>Soares 2015</a>). Determinations of how well an agent does in this regard would require formalizing that question in tandem with developing a scoring metric that evaluates the resulting environment histories, rather than just the agent\ufffds observations. Some theoretical progress has been made by using reflective oracles to model both agents and their environments, enabling agents to have models of one another and converge to various game theoretic equilibria (<a href='https://intelligence.org/files/ReflectiveOraclesAI.pdf' target='_blank'>Fallenstein et al. 2015a</a>).

Deep nets can even incorrectly output very different outputs for only trivially different inputs (<a href='https://cs.nyu.edu/~zaremba/docs/understanding.pdf' target='_blank'>Szegedy et al. 2013</a>). Where applicable, a potential solution is to train on additional subdistributions or variations of a distribution in order to have a more robust model (<a href='http://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v48/amodei16.pdf' target='_blank'>Amodei et al. 2016a</a>), but often the nature, direction, or breadth of the drift will be unknown in advance. There are, however, some approaches to learning with concept drift (<a href='http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/153244301753683726' target='_blank'>Herbster and Warmuth 2001</a>, <a href='http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sbia/sbia2004.html#GamaMCR04' target='_blank'>Gama et al. 2004</a>) in an online context.

A variety of different statistical techniques can be employed to detect or mitigate these issues (<a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565' target='_blank'>Amodei et al. 2016</a>). The method of moments, characterizing learned distributions via their top moments, is a partially-specified model technique for assessing instrumental variables (<a href='http://www.jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v23/anandkumar12/anandkumar12.pdf' target='_blank'>Anandkumar et al. 2012</a>, <a href='http://larspeterhansen.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Uncertainty-Outside-and-Inside-Economic-Models.pdf' target='_blank'>Hansen 2014</a>, <a href='http://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06565' target='_blank'>Amodei et al. 2016</a>).

This is because if an AI system is selecting the actions that best allow it to complete a given task, then avoiding conditions that prevent the system from continuing to pursue the task is a natural consequence and can manifest as an emergent subgoal (<a href='http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/nature_of_self_improving_ai.pdf' target='_blank'>Omohundro 2007</a>, <a href='http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf' target='_blank'>Bostrom 2012</a>).

Following a broader convention and understanding within the artificial intelligence and computer science domains, self-control and reliable decision making fall under validation while operator control falls in the present section. If methods of alignment and control don't scale with how the intelligence of the system scales, a widening gap of potentially dangerous behavior will appear (<a href='https://medium.com/ai-control/scalable-ai-control-7db2436feee7' target='_blank'>Christiano 2015f</a>).

We should thus be mindful of them as we venture into unknown technological and ethical territory, especially in the case of AI. <br><br> S-risks seem to be especially prevalent in advanced AI systems, such as superintelligence, due to the posited ability of superintelligence to rapidly copy software/generate minds, strongly optimize large spaces in arbitrary directions, and perform astronomical amounts of computations at digital timescales, rather than biological timescales (Bostrom 2014).These properties and features can generate s-risks  through sentient simulations, suffering subroutines, suffering routines, the spread of wild animals, and black swan events. (Tomasik 2017) This is highly speculative and, like other concepts mentioned here, is to say nothing of the likelihood of such things, but is brought up as a seeming logical possibility given some assumptions about consciousness and the possibility of machine superintelligence.

This is due to the potential computational intractability of accounting for complex systems and large amounts of causes and conditions that lead to various outcomes.

Furthermore, some forms of consequentialism may be more viable than others, such as two-level utilitarianism and rule utilitarianism as they are the formalization of commitment to, at least in part, higher level principles and generalized rules that can be shared and learned relatively easily. When an agent is able to act or participate in morality based on previously agreed upon or discovered and formulated rules or maxims, said agent cuts down on computational requirements by avoiding the need to continuously take into account all relevant and even possible consequences of actions in new situations.<br><br> There will be cases where purely consequentialist accounts of what ought to be done will be far more tractable, such as with big data driven bioethics in resource limited contexts.

Given that there are many possible forms of utilitarianism, some types, coupled with useful heuristics, probabilistic reasoning, and optimized inductive and deductive reasoning, will be more or less tractable than other forms. Furthermore, defining and effectively measuring which experiential states count as valuable and which count as unvaluable is notoriously difficult.

In the long term, however, if superintelligence is created and the cosmic endowment can be optimized to some end then metaethics becomes crucially important.

To what end should we aim intelligence and why? This can be captured as debates between moral realist and moral anti-realist positions, which consequently have said metaphysical and epistemological implications in ethics and thus in what it means to be a \ufffdbeneficial AI\ufffd.
