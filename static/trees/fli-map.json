{"title": "Value Alignment", "description": "The project of creating value-aligned AI is perhaps one of the most important things we will ever do. However, there are open and often neglected questions regarding what is exactly entailed by 'beneficial AI.' Value alignment is the project of one day creating beneficial AI and has been expanded outside of its usual technical context to reflect and model its truly interdisciplinary nature. For value-aligned AI to become a reality, we need to not only solve intelligence, but also the ends to which intelligence is aimed and the social/political context, rules, and policies in and through which this all happens. This landscape synthesizes a variety of AI safety research agendas along with other papers in AI, machine learning, ethics, governance, and AI safety, robustness, and beneficence research.

This is because if an AI system is selecting the actions that best allow it to complete a given task, then avoiding conditions that prevent the system from continuing to pursue the task is a natural consequence and can manifest as an emergent subgoal (<a href=\"http://selfawaresystems.files.wordpress.com/2008/01/nature_of_self_improving_ai.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Omohundro 2007</a>, <a href=\"http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligentwill.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Bostrom 2012</a>). That could become problematic, however, if one wishes to repurpose the system, to deactivate it, or to significantly alter its decision-making process; such a system would be rational to avoid these changes. Following a broader convention and understanding within the artificial intelligence and computer science domains, self-control and reliable decision making fall under validation while operator control falls in the present section.

Validation is the process of ensuring that a system that meets its formal requirements does not have undesirable behaviors or consequences. It is asking the question \"Did I build (or ask for) the right system?\".<br><br>Ensuring that the formal requirements, the specification, considers all relevant dynamics, and will be beneficial and desirable, does not actually fit into current formally provable paradigms. In order to build systems that robustly behave well, one currently needs to decide what <i>good</i> behavior means in each application domain. This ethical question of good is tied closely to questions of what technologies and engineering techniques are available, how reliable they are, and what trade-offs can be made  all areas where computer science, software engineering, machine learning, and broader AI expertise are valuable. In practical application, a significant consideration is the computational expense of different behavioral standards or ethical theories, i.e. that if a standard cannot be evaluated sufficiently expeditiously to guide behavior in safety-critical situations, cheaper approximations should be used (<a href=\"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/moral-machines-9780195374049\" target=\"_blank\">Wallach and Allen 2008</a>).

This is relatively straightforward when specific safety limitations, behaviors, and ethical constraints are known upfront for AI systems that are largely specified upfront (<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04450.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Berkenkamp et al. 2016</a>, <a href=\"http://papers.nips.cc/paper/3747-help-or-hinder-bayesian-models-of-social-goal-inference.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Ullman et al. 2009</a>), but more powerful and operationally-flexible systems require much more sophistication.

Being able to assure known bounded behaviors from methods and systems that learn will also be important for both medium-term and long-term safety. Validation encompasses ensuring an agent understands its environment, decisions, and actions, and that it acts robustly-in-accordance with its operators' wishes.<br><br>In the long term, AI systems might become much more powerful, general-purpose, and autonomous, a regime where failures of validity would carry significantly higher costs than with today's systems. To maximize the long-term value of validity research, machine learning researchers might focus on anticipating, preventing, detecting, and mitigating the types of otherwise unexpected generalization that would be most problematic for very general and capable AI systems. If some concepts could be learned reliably, it might become possible to use those to define tasks or constraints that minimize the chances of unintended consequences even when agents become very general and capable.
