# Interactive Research Maps

This is the git repo for [AI Research Maps](https://www.airesearchmaps.com/). It is an interactive tool built for visualizing large research fields (though it can be used to visualize any hierarchical data). This repo also features a rich infinite canvas component with mobile support!

## Video Demo

## Developing

Once you've git cloned and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you can start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
