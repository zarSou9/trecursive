# Interactive Research Maps

This is the git repo for [TRecursive](https://www.trecursive.com/): an interactive 2D canvas app for visualizing hierarchical knowledge. This repo also features a rich infinite canvas component with mobile support!

## Developing

Once you've git cloned and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), you can start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
